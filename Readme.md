# Vue to do 2 Node API

This is a node/express/mongodb API for use with the [vue-2-to-do](https://github.com/chris-schmitz/vue-2-to-do) vue.js client project.


## Get up and running 

```
git clone https://github.com/chris-schmitz/vue-2-to-do-node-server.git
cd vue-2-to-do-node-server
npm install

npm run serve:db
# in a new terminal tab
npm run serve:api
```

This API is a really simple implementation used mostly to flesh out the vue-2-to-do client. I'm still pretty new to both express and mongodb so this, I'm sure, is not the best implementation of either, but it works ;).
